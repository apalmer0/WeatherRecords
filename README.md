# WeatherRecords

Every time it's really hot or really cold out, I find myself wondering:
is today's temperature a record? I could never easily find that answer
using existing weather apps so this one sets out to answer it for me. 
Along with displaying the current temperature and forecast, this app
also displays the record high and low for the day in order to easily
compare today's temperature against historical records.

This is a bare React Native application. I hope to eventually rebuild 
it with Expo, though it seems Weather Underground has changed their 
API policy so I'll need to find a new data source first.
